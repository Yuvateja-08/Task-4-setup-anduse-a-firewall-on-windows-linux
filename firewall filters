##How Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall filters traffic based on predefined rules, controlling inbound and outbound network traffic. 
It can block or allow traffic based on parameters like port number, protocol (TCP/UDP), source/destination IP, etc. 
This helps protect the system from unauthorized access and malicious traffic.
